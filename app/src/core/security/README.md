# Rising-BSM Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in Rising-BSM to protect against common web vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Middleware Security

**File**: `src/middleware.ts` & `src/middleware/security.ts`

- **Attack Detection**: Automatically detects and blocks common attack patterns
- **Path Protection**: Blocks access to sensitive files and directories
- **Security Headers**: Implements comprehensive security headers including CSP, HSTS, and more
- **Request Logging**: Monitors all requests for security analysis

### 2. Rate Limiting

**File**: `src/core/security/rate-limiter.ts`

Multiple rate limiters for different endpoints:
- **API Rate Limiter**: 60 requests/minute
- **Auth Rate Limiter**: 5 requests/minute
- **Password Reset**: 3 requests/hour
- **Public Endpoints**: 30 requests/minute

Features:
- Automatic IP blocking after violations
- Configurable block durations
- Memory-efficient cleanup

### 3. Security Monitoring

**File**: `src/core/security/monitoring.ts`

Real-time security event tracking:
- Attack pattern detection
- Threat level analysis
- IP blocking management
- Security event logging
- Automated threat response

### 4. Security Dashboard

**File**: `src/app/dashboard/security/page.tsx`

Admin interface for security monitoring:
- Real-time threat overview
- Blocked IP management
- Security event timeline
- Attack pattern analysis
- Security recommendations

## Protected Paths

The following paths are automatically blocked:
- Environment files (`.env`, `.env.local`, etc.)
- Configuration files (`config.json`, `database.yml`, etc.)
- Database dumps (`*.sql`, `dump.sql`, etc.)
- Version control (`.git`, `.gitignore`)
- PHP files (we're not a PHP application)
- Common CMS paths (WordPress, etc.)
- Package management files

## Attack Pattern Detection

The system detects and blocks:
- SQL injection attempts
- Path traversal attacks
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Known vulnerability scanners
- Suspicious user agents
- Common attack patterns

## Security Headers

All responses include:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy: restrictive`
- `Content-Security-Policy` (production only)
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (HTTPS only)

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Generate Secure Credentials

Run the security environment generator:

```bash
cd C:\Rising-BSM\app
node scripts/generate-secure-env.ts
```

This will:
- Generate a secure JWT secret
- Create a strong database password
- Set up session secrets
- Create encryption keys

### 2. Update Database Password

After generating credentials:
1. Update your PostgreSQL password to match the generated one
2. Consider changing the default 'postgres' username
3. Restrict database access to localhost only

### 3. Configure Production Settings

For production deployment:
1. Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `.env.local`
2. Enable HTTPS and configure SSL certificates
3. Set up a reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) with additional security rules
4. Configure email settings for security alerts

### 4. Monitor Security

1. Access the security dashboard at `/dashboard/security`
2. Review blocked IPs regularly
3. Monitor attack patterns
4. Follow security recommendations

## Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env.local`** to version control
2. **Regularly update dependencies** for security patches
3. **Monitor security logs** for suspicious activity
4. **Implement IP whitelisting** for admin endpoints if possible
5. **Use a WAF** (Web Application Firewall) in production
6. **Enable audit logging** for all administrative actions
7. **Implement 2FA** for admin accounts
8. **Regular security audits** and penetration testing

## Testing Security

### Test Rate Limiting
```bash
# Test API rate limiting (should block after 60 requests/minute)
for i in {1..70}; do curl http://localhost:3000/api/users; done

# Test auth rate limiting (should block after 5 requests/minute)
for i in {1..10}; do curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login -d '{}'; done
```

### Test Path Blocking
```bash
# These should all return 404
curl http://localhost:3000/.env
curl http://localhost:3000/config.json
curl http://localhost:3000/db.sql
```

### Test Attack Detection
```bash
# SQL injection attempt (should be blocked)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/users?id=1' OR '1'='1"

# Path traversal attempt (should be blocked)
curl http://localhost:3000/../../../etc/passwd
```

## Security Monitoring API

### Get Security Dashboard Data
```http
GET /api/security/dashboard
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
```

### Block an IP
```http
POST /api/security/block-ip
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "reason": "Suspicious activity",
  "duration": 86400000
}
```

### Unblock an IP
```http
DELETE /api/security/block-ip?ip=192.168.1.100
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
```

## Incident Response

When an attack is detected:

1. **Automatic Response**:
   - IP is tracked and potentially blocked
   - Event is logged with full details
   - Rate limits are enforced

2. **Manual Review**:
   - Check security dashboard
   - Review attack patterns
   - Block persistent attackers
   - Update security rules if needed

3. **Post-Incident**:
   - Analyze attack patterns
   - Update security measures
   - Document lessons learned
   - Share with team

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
1. **Redis-based rate limiting** for distributed systems
2. **Database-backed IP blocking** for persistence
3. **GeoIP blocking** for region-based restrictions
4. **Machine learning** for anomaly detection
5. **Integration with fail2ban** or similar tools
6. **Security event notifications** via email/Slack
7. **Automated security reports**
8. **Integration with SIEM systems**

## Support

For security concerns or questions:
1. Check the security dashboard for current status
2. Review application logs for detailed information
3. Contact the security team for critical issues
4. Report vulnerabilities responsibly

Remember: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time implementation. Stay vigilant and keep your systems updated.
