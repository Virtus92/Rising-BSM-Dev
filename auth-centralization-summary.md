# Authentication System Centralization

## Summary of Implemented Changes

### 1. AuthService Implementation
- Properly implemented the `IAuthService` and `IRefreshTokenService` interfaces directly in the `AuthServiceClass`
- Moved external method attachments into class methods with proper typing
- Added proper method implementations for all required interface methods
- Added complete documentation for all methods

### 2. ServiceFactory Implementation
- Fixed `ServiceFactory` to properly implement `IServiceFactory`
- Added the missing `resetServices()` method
- Updated type declarations to use interface types rather than concrete implementations
- Added proper error handling across implementations

### 3. Auth Middleware Updates
- Fixed type issues in `authMiddleware.ts`
- Added proper type casting and error handling in authentication flow
- Updated the `checkPermissions` function to accept `Record<string, any>` instead of direct `number` parameters
- Fixed user object construction to ensure all required properties are present

### 4. Route Handler Enhancement
- Updated `route-handler.ts` to correctly use the auth middleware
- Fixed the auth handler middleware call with proper parameter structure
- Improved authentication checks and error handling

### 5. Component Fixes
- Updated `AppointmentForm.tsx` to correctly access API response properties
- Fixed conditional function checks in `NewRequests.tsx` and `useUpcomingAppointments.ts`
- Added proper type checks for function vs property detection

### 6. Eliminated TokenManager
- Removed the redundant `tokenUtils.ts` file
- All token management is now centralized in `AuthService`

### 7. Added Missing Service Implementation
- Created a proper `PermissionService.client.ts` implementation for missing exports
- Added the necessary index.ts file to export properly named interfaces

## Key Architectural Improvements

1. **Centralized Authentication**: All auth functionality is now in `AuthService`
2. **Proper Interface Implementation**: All interfaces are directly implemented in the classes
3. **Type Safety**: Added robust type checking and improved error handling
4. **Removed Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate token management code
5. **Consistent Error Handling**: Used AuthErrorHandler consistently across the authentication flow
6. **Improved Structure**: Better organized code with clear responsibility boundaries

## Backward Compatibility

- Added appropriate exports for backward compatibility
- Maintained existing API patterns where needed

This implementation follows the "work properly or throw proper errors" philosophy by focusing on strict interface implementation, proper error handling, and eliminating redundant components.
