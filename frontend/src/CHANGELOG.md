# User Management System Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the improvements made to fix issues in the user management system.

### 1. Domain Entity and Type Handling

- Enhanced `User` entity with proper validation methods for `role` and `status` fields
- Fixed edge cases in entity construction to ensure type safety
- Added `isManagerOrAbove()` method to support role hierarchy checks
- Improved `UserType` type alias with additional properties for better consistency

### 2. DTO Mapping and Validation

- Improved `mapUserToDto` function to handle null values safely
- Added better validation in `UserForm` to prevent invalid data submission
- Fixed profile picture upload to use data URLs for proper form submission

### 3. Repository and Service Layer

- Fixed `mapToDomainEntity` in UserRepository to properly handle null entities
- Improved error handling in `getUserActivity` to prevent crashes with bad data
- Added safe JSON parsing for activity logs
- Improved `logActivityImplementation` to gracefully handle missing database models
- Added permission cache invalidation when user roles change

### 4. API Endpoints

- Added validation for role parameters in `/api/permissions/role-defaults/[role]`
- Enhanced security in `/api/users/permissions` to prevent unauthorized access
- Improved permission validation in POST handlers to filter out invalid permissions
- Added caching mechanisms with proper invalidation

### 5. Frontend Components

- Created a reusable `useMediaQuery` hook to consistently detect mobile devices
- Replaced duplicated mobile detection code with the new hook
- Fixed `UserList` component to properly handle filter updates and prevent race conditions
- Improved `UserForm` with client-side validation before submission
- Fixed profile picture upload to use proper data URLs

### 6. Authentication Flow

- Enhanced `DashboardInitializer` to make authentication more robust
- Fixed token synchronization between localStorage and cookies
- Added proper error handling with an improved error boundary component
- Created a client-side error logging API endpoint

### 7. Permission Management

- Fixed `UserPermissions` component to properly handle API data and enum values
- Added ability to handle unknown permissions not defined in the enums
- Improved security checks for permission management endpoints

### 8. General Improvements

- Added consistent error handling throughout the application
- Improved type safety with proper TypeScript typing
- Reduced console logging in production code
- Added intelligent retry mechanisms for critical operations
- Created a more robust error boundary system

## Security Improvements

- Added validation of user roles and permissions to prevent privilege escalation
- Fixed permissions cache invalidation to ensure permission changes are immediately effective
- Added better authentication validation and verification
- Improved token handling to prevent token leakage
- Enhanced security checks in API routes
