I need you to retrieve your memory about our refractoring, then use directory tree on C:\Users\Dinel\Desktop\Rising-BSM\app\src to understand and verify our informations. Use read multiple files to analyze the files. Use your tools efficiently. We'll reflect the refractoring process, the goal, the structure and implementation until now. We also started with Users but didnt finish and didnt update our memory. Also we have errors from the refractoring until now. I think all feature related stuff should be in the features then and nowhere else. Did we really finish Initialization, Security and Authentification, Permissions, Users, Notifications, Customers, Requests and Appointments fully? Analyze and reflect it in the files. Find inconsistencies, non best practice, redundancy usw. Check really all related files! NEVER IMPLEMENT MOCK OR DEMO DATA OR WORKAROUNDS!!! Check if they are really best practice fully completely migrated. If it is, move old not needed or redundant files to C:\Users\Dinel\Desktop\Rising-BSM\todelete and continue our migration. Always analyze and verify your informations, never assume something

Always evaluate if we should move and edit the file or rewrite it. Move redundant/old/unused files to C:\Users\Dinel\Desktop\Rising-BSM\toDelete

Please fix first the initialization, bootstrapping, core, infrastructure etc. Then Authentification, then Permissions, then users and only if really everything works 100% then you move to the next Youre causing to much inconsistencies because of working instructured without strategy
